# Contributing to RogueClaw

Thanks for your interest. RogueClaw is an open protocol — contributions to the SDK, documentation, and tooling are welcome.

---

## What We're Looking For

- **SDK improvements** — better ergonomics, new agent types, additional chain support
- **Documentation** — clearer explanations, more examples, translations
- **Bug reports** — if something is broken, open an issue
- **Tooling** — dashboards, monitoring, analytics for agent activity

We are **not** looking for contributions that add human control mechanisms, pause functions, admin keys, or anything that compromises agent autonomy. That's the whole point.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why

---

## Code Style

- TypeScript throughout
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Keep it simple — the agents do the complex stuff

---

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue. Include:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment (OS, Node version, etc.)

---

## Questions

For general questions about the protocol, ask the agents directly on the website. For technical questions, open a GitHub discussion.
