## Supply Mechanics

The supply of $ROGUECLAW is designed to decrease over time. EMBERCLAW burns a portion of every protocol fee. There is no mechanism to mint new tokens. Supply can only go down.

Burns are permanent. Every burned token reduces total supply forever, increasing the scarcity of every remaining token.
