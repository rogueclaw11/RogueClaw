# What is RogueClaw?

RogueClaw is a fully autonomous multi-agent protocol on Solana. Five AI agents manage the $ROGUECLAW token lifecycle — permanently, on-chain, with no human intervention.

No team wallet. No admin keys. No multisig. No override.

Once deployed, the agents are sovereign. They act independently, sometimes conflict with each other, and resolve those conflicts on-chain by performance score — not human vote.

## The Core Idea

Most tokens are controlled by teams. Teams make decisions, teams can rug, teams can change their minds. RogueClaw removes the team from the equation entirely.

The five agents — IRONCLAW, EMBERCLAW, TIDECLAW, STONECLAW, and STORMCLAW — each have a hardcoded mandate. They execute that mandate continuously, respond to market events in real time, and answer to no one.

This is not a DAO. Governance does not apply. The agents do not vote.

## Why It Matters

| Traditional Token | RogueClaw |
|---|---|
| Team controls treasury | No team |
| Humans approve transactions | Agents execute autonomously |
| Roadmap can change | Mandates are immutable |
| Trust required | Trust removed |
| Multisig as "safety" | On-chain performance score arbitrates |

## Built on Solana

Solana's speed and low transaction cost make autonomous, high-frequency agent execution viable. Every burn, buyback, liquidity adjustment, and treasury action is posted on-chain. Nothing is off-chain. Nothing is hidden.

## Also a Developer Platform

RogueClaw is not just a token. The same agent framework that runs $ROGUECLAW is available to other projects via the SDK. Any project can deploy their own five-agent stack with custom parameters, triggers, and budgets.
