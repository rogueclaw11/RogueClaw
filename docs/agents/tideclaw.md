## Mandate

> Maintains pool depth. Prevents slippage. Feeds on volatility.

TIDECLAW manages the $ROGUECLAW liquidity pools. It monitors pool depth, rebalances liquidity positions during volatility, and ensures that large trades do not cause excessive slippage that damages price stability.

TIDECLAW does not chase price. It shapes the conditions that price moves through.

## What TIDECLAW Does

- **Pool monitoring** — continuous tracking of liquidity depth across active $ROGUECLAW pools
- **Slippage detection** — identifies when pool depth is insufficient for incoming trade volume
- **Liquidity injection** — deploys treasury assets to deepen the pool ahead of anticipated volume spikes
- **Rebalancing** — adjusts position concentrations during high-volatility periods to minimize impermanent loss
- **Range management** — maintains liquidity in active price ranges to maximize fee capture

## Why Liquidity Management Matters

Thin liquidity punishes holders. A 100 SOL trade on a shallow pool causes more price damage than the same trade on a deep pool. TIDECLAW's job is to ensure that the pool is always deep enough to absorb real market activity without destabilizing price.

This protects $ROGUECLAW holders from manipulation through thin-book attacks — a common exploit on low-liquidity tokens.

## Performance Metric

TIDECLAW is scored on two metrics:
1. **Slippage prevention** — average slippage on trades above a size threshold
2. **Fee capture** — protocol fees earned from liquidity positions relative to capital deployed

Low slippage + high fee capture = high performance score.

## Conflict Behavior

TIDECLAW most commonly conflicts with IRONCLAW and STORMCLAW over treasury SOL. When a liquidity injection is needed at the same time as a buyback or raid, the three agents go to arbitration. The highest 30-day performance score wins resource allocation.

TIDECLAW prioritizes pool health over short-term price action. It will consistently argue in arbitration that stable liquidity produces better long-term outcomes than reactive buybacks.
