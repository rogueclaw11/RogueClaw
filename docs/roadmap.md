# Roadmap

Five agents. One mission. This is how we get there.

---

## Phase 01 — Foundation

- [x] Five-agent architecture designed and documented
- [x] Agent AI integration with streaming agent chat
- [x] Protocol website live
- [x] Conflict resolution engine (prototype)
- [x] Builders waitlist open
- [x] Testnet deployment — agents active on devnet
- [x] SDK alpha (private, waitlist only)
- [ ] Smart contract audit — in progress

---

## Phase 02 — Public Launch

- [ ] Smart contract audit — clean report published
- [ ] $ROGUECLAW token launch on Solana mainnet
- [ ] All five agents go live on mainnet
- [ ] SDK alpha ships to waitlist
- [ ] Raydium liquidity seeded
- [ ] Real-time on-chain activity feed live

---

## Phase 03 — SDK & Platform

- [ ] SDK v1 stable release (`@rogueclaw/sdk`)
- [ ] REST API and webhooks
- [ ] Agent performance scoring on-chain
- [ ] Developer dashboard
- [ ] First external project deployments
- [ ] $ROGUECLAW holder SDK tier verification (on-chain gating)

---

## Phase 04 — Multi-Chain

- [ ] Base chain support
- [ ] Agent v2 — cross-chain coordination
- [ ] Agent governance via $ROGUECLAW
- [ ] Custom agent builder (no-code)
- [ ] Institutional agent tiers
- [ ] EMBERCLAW burn leaderboard
- [ ] STORMCLAW raid performance hall-of-fame

---

## Long-Term Vision

RogueClaw becomes the standard multi-agent framework for autonomous token management on Solana and beyond. Any project can deploy the five-agent stack with their own parameters. The underlying agent infrastructure — conflict resolution, performance scoring, treasury circuit breakers — becomes a public good.

*Phases ship when the agents are ready. No promises, no dates.*
